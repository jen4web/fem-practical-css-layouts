CHAPTER 3C: EASY DESIGN - Reviews and footer


Start: https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/rNqmBdN

To get the review under control, we need to do the following:
  * Set images to have spacing on top
  * Set stars to a smaller size and next to each other
  * Style the quotes to look like the design
  * Establish spacing between tour and reviews


  1. Set images to have spacing on top

  Each unit has some spacing on top to separate it from the next unit.

    .imggroup {
    margin-top: 2rem;
  }

  2. Set stars to a smaller size and next to each other

    .star {
	  width: 18px;
	}

	Why are they next to each other? Why didn't we have to use Flexbox or Grid to make this happen?

  3. Style the quotes to look like the design, add basic HTML styles to the base styling

    blockquote {
	  margin: 0;
	  padding: 0;
	}
	cite {
	  font-style: normal;
	  display: block;
	  margin-top: -3px;
	}

  4. Establish spacing between tour and reviews, base styling
	  main {
		  margin-bottom: 4rem;
	  }

 
5. Format the footer, base styling.

footer {
  margin-top: 5rem;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
