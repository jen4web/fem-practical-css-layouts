CHAPTER 4F: FINAL SITE ASSEMBLY FOR MOBILE AND TABLET

We have everything coded for this page, at least in mobile format. Let's assemble this into a single document.

Begin: https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/ZEqJPed

Fork the starting head of the document we already created.

Now add elements:

* https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/vYVJEMo -- album cover and track
* https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/KKGmEyw -- reviews and images
* https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/ExdmGyL -- new album and track list
* https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/XWxRdrQ -- footer
* https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/XWxRdrQ -- we're missing the button styles from the tour page! Grab those and add to "album"

We're missing the wrapper - add the HTML from "Tour" plus the two media queries. Test in full view - not centered.

Go to "base", add .wrapper { margin: 0 auto; } to center it on the page.

Go to "audio", add     padding-bottom: 2rem; to .cover to give space between player and next section.

Note that the album cover has a blue border on it for tablet and desktop. Let's add that as well. In the "audio" layer:

  @media (min-width: 700px) {
    .cover img {
      border: 1px solid var(--cyan);
    }
  }
