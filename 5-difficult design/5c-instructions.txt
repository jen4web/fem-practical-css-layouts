This CodePen includes the navbar, album cover, audio player, and tracklist from our medium design, including markup and CSS.

I've mixed in the CSS from our previous work (base, reviews, album, footer) with the CSS from our medium final design (nav, audio, playlist). Everything seems to be working well.

To the HTML, I've added 2 more links for this design, Music and Signup.

The JavaScript panel contains the scripts to run the hamburger button and the audio player.

Review the current design -- you can see the nav is a bit rough in its design, although the functionality still works fine.

Let's tweak the nav for the two breakpoints.

500px, 800px, 1000px

At 500px, what do we want to see?
* lime logo and hamburger button, aligned over top of cover

* remove max-width from #top -- let the wrapper control the overall width

* .bandname outside of MQ -   .bandname {
    display: none;
  }
  does not display at < 500px

Over 500px, the band name does display
/* where the band name displays */
  @media (min-width: 500px) {
    .bandname {
      display: inline;
    }
  }
}

Note the max-width MQ is all about the hamburger button and needs no change.

Note that at 800px we have a moment with the band name and hamburger - reducing the MQ to 799px prevents this.
