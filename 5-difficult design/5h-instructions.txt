5H: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

Let's assemble everything we've built into a single page.

* Small elements:

* Double border corners: https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/KKGQLxd

* Nav tweaks: https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/WNaMqWE

* Cover icons: https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/BaqYXKd

* Tracklist tablet: https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/OJBvypV

* Diamond images: https://codepen.io/jen4web/pen/wvYmKbJ

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
- Fork the "double border corners" pen, which has commenting in the HTML for where additional HTML should be added.

- From the Diamonds pen, copy the CSS and JavaScript and paste to the "double border" pen.

- Copy the appropriate HTML from all other pens and paste into the "double border" pen.

- Test - you should have a design that works for mobile and tablet.

A few tweaks:
- add aside.diamond-border to the HTML around the diamond display. Place the border on this:

  .diamond-border {
    border: 2px solid var(--cyan);
  }

  Now the diamond box will be as big as the other boxes on tablet.

  - .album style should be     margin: 2rem auto;
Starts at 0 auto

And we're ready to add the desktop styling!
