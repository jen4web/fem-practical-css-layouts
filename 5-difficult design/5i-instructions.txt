We'll make a few tweaks to our page so it will work at a desktop dimension.

First -- group header, main-grid, and reviews in a div.left.

Group album.maglime, diamond-border, and cta in a div.right.

We now have a wrapper with 3 children: left, right, and footer.

We need to set our desktop min-width MQ to 1400px from 1000px. Set it to have 2 columns, with a 60/40 split.

@media (min-width: 1400px) { 
  .wrapper {
    max-width: 1440px;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 6fr 4fr;
  }
  .hidetablet, .hidemobile {
    display: block;
  }
  .left {
    grid-column: 1/2;
    grid-row: 1/2;
  }
  .right {
    grid-column: 2/3;
    grid-row: 1/3;
    margin-bottom: 5rem;
  }
  footer {
    grid-column: 1/2;
    grid-row: 2/3;
    margin-top: -20rem;
  }

}

For the navigation - if you want to align this better with the album cover, add     max-width: 600px;
to the #top style under nav.

To better align the top nav to the name, change #top ul to gap: 1rem, margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;
